### Bio

Scott Ogle is a UI engineer and journalism studuent in Fort Collins, CO.  I'm a bit obsessed with data visualization, software, and thinking about ways to hack journalism.  I currently work at [Semantic Arts](http://semanticarts.com/), a semantic technology consultancy where I work on UI development and data visualization projects.

I'm also a minimalist, but minimally so.
