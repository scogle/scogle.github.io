<br />

### Bio

I'm a software engineer in Portland, OR. By day I'm at a company called [Vacasa](https://www.vacasa.com/) where I'm working to buid a kick-ass engineering team to improve the way we onboard employees. On the weekend I mountain bike, ski, climb and backpack around the Pacific Northwest.

I'm a minimalist, but minimally so.

### About the site

This site was built using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (which makes web development fun again! Really!) and [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/).  It's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

The font used on the site is [Vollkorn](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Vollkorn) by Friedrich Althausen.
