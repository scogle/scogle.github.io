A while back, in an occasion that has actually been [written about](http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/2014/09/11/911-vs-snowden-my-students-surprising-debate-about-privacy-and-government/) by one of my instructors, *Forbes* contributor [Michael Humphrey](http://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelhumphrey/), I brought up the issue of encryption in a senior-level college journalism class.  Specifically, we were talking about the new [encrypted email service ProtonMail](https://protonmail.ch/index.php)

My earnest expectation was that encryption, personal information security and privacy in general would be unequivocally and uncontroversially popular.  I have long regarded privacy as a basic right and as an absolute good, and my naive expectation was that any journalist, even (or perhaps especially) a student journalist, would have a similar attitude.

I was way off.

A surprising number of people voiced the opinion that encryption could be dangerous if used by terrorists and criminals.  Several people actually suggested some technology that was "encrypted" but still accessible by the government.  No one that I can remember seemed to think that encrypted email was something a law-abiding citizen would or should want. 

Humphrey wrote a fair bit about the possible cultural and sociological conditions for this to play out--fear of Islamic State and millenials having grown up in a post-9/11 world, among others.  But what about views towards privacy in general?  I think the views towards communication privacy are actually experiencing something of a radical shift. In the past, any invasion of privacy has largely been viewed as contemptible; now we will put happily put up with much more.

There's an excellent article from NYT's *The Upshot* that gets at the heart of this issue--["Americans say they want privacy but act as if they don't"](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/13/upshot/americans-say-they-want-privacy-but-act-as-if-they-dont.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&module=mini-moth&region=top-stories-below&WT.nav=top-stories-below&_r=2&abt=0002&abg=1). In short, the article exposes the doublethink we all engage in by claiming to value privacy while giving it up more than ever. But buried in there is an even more interesting bit:

> "People with more education and higher incomes tend to be more sensitive about their online privacy, Pew found."

That ought to be alarming, because there is *no reason whatsoever* that a wealthier, more educated person ought to value privacy more. And it's not saying that more educated people are more informedabout privacy or best practices for keeping themselves secure, but simply that they are *more sensitive* than their less-educated counterparts.  I'm tempted to view this as an aspect of digital literacy--since it *could* be framed as a question of whether or not people know that they can and should value their privacy.

In any case, the idea that there is a socio-economic element to the subjective value of privacy raises another, more philosophical question about why privacy might be valued *at all*, and why it seems to matter more not just to some individuals but to some classes of people.

Quoting Georgetown University professor Julie Cohen in an [article in The Atlantic by Jathan Sadowski](http://theatln.tc/1z3yD80) (emphasis mine):

> Cohen doesn't think we should treat privacy as a dispensable instrument. To the contrary, she argues privacy is irreducible to a "fixed condition or attribute (such as seclusion or control) whose boundaries can be crisply delineated by the application of deductive logic. **Privacy is shorthand for breathing room to engage in the process of ... self-development.**"
